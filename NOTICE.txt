This product includes software developed at Spring (https://spring.io/)
* TqCron is a derivative of springframework's CronSequenceGenerator.

This product includes software developed by Ben Manes
(https://github.com/ben-manes/concurrentlinkedhashmap). The
io.tekniq.cache.concurrentlinkedhashmap package is a direct copy of the
code located at the github repo with the package renamed to support the
embedded use of the library without conflict with external inclusion.

This product also includes software developed by Jon Kelly
(https://github.com/jkelly467/kossh). The SSH library is a direct copy
of the code located at the github repo with the package names changed
to fit the io.tekniq.ssh namespace. License use was unclear as nothing
was published around the licensing model. Also no existing means of
distribution via maven existed as well. Thus integrating this directly
into tekniq where ease of distribution and further code maintenance may
take place.
