# tekniq-sparklin
This module is considered deprecated and will be removed from the project as a whole. It is strongly recommended that instead you utilize [Javalin](https://javalin.io/) instead.

Javalin is syntactically similar to Sparklin but is far better supported and maintained then is the Spark project that Sparklin is based off of.
